# horrible calculator

This is something I'm using to learn C++.

To run, compile using your favorite tool. The command output will look like:

```bash
welcome to horrible calculator
enter an expression or press 'e' to exit.
>>
```

The available operations are: `+, -, *, /` and this only works with integers.

An example:

```bash
welcome to horrible calculator
enter an expression or press 'e' to exit.
>> 33-3
found - at 2
33
3
calc = 30
enter an expression or press 'e' to exit.
>>
```

It's very easy to break:

```bash
enter an expression or press 'e' to exit.
>> cc
no operators found
(and more errors)
```

You probably don't want to do your taxes with this program.
